JSI, Just Share It
===========================

##About
JSI is a file sharing web page inspired on Dropbox, where users could upload and download small files.
I am a contributor to the design and development of JSI, a web-based software for
file sharing. JSI is a traditional three tier application, whose design has
been carefully studied to be natively modular and resilient. The presentation layer
comprises a web interface (developed in PHP). The presentation layer currently
implemented relies on the latest and most prominent technologies both client- and
server-side: on the client-side it provides a standard-compliant HTML interface, that is
dynamically adapted to user activities via javascript and AJAX technologies; on the
server side it was developed using PHP. About the data persistency layer, we developed an abstract object access interface that automatically manages persistency (backed by a database) and offers application-specific locking techniques that guarantee data consistency, high system performances
and high scalability
